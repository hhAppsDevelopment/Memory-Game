# Memory Game
## The concept
This application concentrates on helping students with their pair-related subjects. The teacher can specify pairs, which is then saved locally and can be accessed by the students.
## The project
This project is the final product of our mentoring efforts, created by a student in their last grade, just before graduating secondary school.
## Known issues
1. Cannot save new pair-file.
2. Some exceptions are not handled, application is easy to crash
3. Lacking revision on UI, not too user-friendly

## To try it out
As there is no executable file of any kind, you need to compile and run them yourself.
